  <p>u should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.After Thanos, an intergalactic warlord, disintegrates half of the universe, the Avengers must reunite and assemble again to reinvigorate their trounced allies and restore balance.
